## Mint and burn
This is a basic Solidity smart contract . 

## DESCIRPTION
This Solidity smart contract contains several features to manage a custom token. It includes two public variables: one for the token's name and another for its abbreviation. The contract also has a variable that keeps track of the total token supply. To manage user balances, there is a mapping variable named "balances" that connects addresses with their corresponding token balances.
The contract provides two essential functions: "mint" and "burn." The "mint" function allows the contract owner to increase the balance of a specific address by a given amount of tokens. On the other hand, the "burn" function allows the contract owner to decrease the balance of a specified address by a certain number of tokens, but only if the address has a sufficient balance to accommodate the requested reduction. In essence, these functions enable the contract owner to create new tokens (mint) and destroy existing tokens (burn) for specific addresses in the system.

## COMPILER 
Using remixIDE 

## EXECUTING THE PROGRAM
* Create a new folder
* Write the contract
* Compile it
* After compiling, deploy the contract .
* To mint tokens, click on the "Mint" button, paste the account address, enter the desired token quantity and click "Transact".
* To check the balance, click on "Balances," paste the account address, and click "Call" to view the balance.
* To burn tokens, click on "Burn," paste the account address, set the value to be burnt, and click "Transact" to reduce tokens from the account.
* To check the balance again, press "Call" to obtain the latest balance..
